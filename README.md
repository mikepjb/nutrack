This is a web application that breaksdown the value of your weekly shop, in

### Getting Started

To develop this product, I am using Emacs + Cider:

Use the `cider-jack-in-cljs` command to open a Clojurescript REPL and browser
page that will live reload your changes.

To work on the command line:

`clojure -m figwheel.main --build nutrack`
